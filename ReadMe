This Application is developed for the Lab3 of Concurrent Programming Module.
As per the requirement the code is built with the mean of 30 secs and 20 mins which is time consuming.
So two seperate jar files are provided.

To run the proper application run the command
java -jar BusProblem.jar

TO run a quick version of the applicaiton run the command. THis is the same code with small means.
java -jar BusProblemQuick.jar

Further to ensure the code open a terminal in src folder and run the following command
java Application.

To alter the code for fast execution change the getRandom() method in both generators.
instead of the multiplying by 1000, a multiplication of 10 in that line will do the needful.
